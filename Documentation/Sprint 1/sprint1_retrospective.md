# Sprint 1 Retrospective - Enhanced Edition

---

## Executive Summary

During Sprint 1, our team made substantial progress towards our project goals. We focused on creating a landing page with registration and sign-in capabilities for both student and lecturer roles. Also, lecturers can set their availability time. Initially, 7 user stories and 1 developer-sized story were allocated for this sprint, making a total of 8 stories. We managed to complete 6 stories, including 5 user stories and 1 developer-sized story. Our estimated velocity was 16/3 (story points of stories delivered/ total number of sprints) which is 5.3.

## Achievements

### Feature Development

- **Landing Page**: A gateway to our platform was successfully implemented. This not only serves as an introduction to our service, but also as a user management hub.
- **User Registration**: We developed the ability for users to register themselves as either a student or a lecturer, expanding the accessibility and usability of our service.
- **User Sign-In**: Alongside registration, we also established the ability for users to sign in, ensuring a personalized experience.

### Stories

- **Assignment**: A total of 8 stories (7 user stories and 1 developer-sized story) were assigned to this sprint.
- **Completion**: We successfully completed 6 stories, including 5 user stories and 1 developer-sized story, demonstrating significant progress.
- **Remaining**: 2 stories were not completed.

## Successes

- **Quality Code**: Our team prided itself on writing high-quality code that adhered to best practices such as the use of partials and following an MVC architecture and we also maintained a strong standard of consistency.
- **Communication and Collaboration**: We hosted multiple meetings to discuss file structure, coding styles, and to ensure effective collaboration, which contributed to our overall success.

## Areas of Concern

- **Time Management**: We identified the need to improve our time management as certain stories were dependent on the completion of others, which caused a delay in progress.
- **Task Complexity**: We underestimated the complexity of some tasks, which resulted in an overambitious workload for the given sprint duration.

---

## Recommendations for Improvement

- **Improved Time Management**: We must better plan our stories with respect to dependencies and priorities to ensure a smoother workflow and more efficient time management.
- **DRY Principle**: We need to emphasize the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in our coding practices. This will result in more efficient, maintainable, and adaptable code, thereby enhancing the overall development process.

In summary, Sprint 1 presented us with valuable insights and learnings. We are confident that with these observations, we can fine-tune our strategies for future sprints, improving our productivity and code quality.
