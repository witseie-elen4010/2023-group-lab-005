## Code Style Guide

1. Use meaningful variable and function names: Use descriptive and meaningful names that convey the purpose and functionality of variables, functions, and classes. Avoid using cryptic or ambiguous names.

2. Follow coding standards and guidelines: Follow a set of coding standards and guidelines that are consistent with the programming language and best practices. This includes formatting, naming conventions, comments, and documentation as described here: https://standardjs.com/rules.html

3. Write clean and concise code: Write code that is clean, concise, and easy to understand. This includes avoiding redundant code, using appropriate data structures and algorithms, and keeping code modular and reusable.

4. Test code thoroughly: Ensure that all code is thoroughly tested and that test cases cover all possible scenarios and edge cases. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests.

5. Use version control: Use a version control system to manage code changes, track bugs, and collaborate with other developers. This includes using descriptive commit messages and avoiding committing code that is not ready for production.

6. Use code analysis tools: Use code analysis tools to automatically detect issues such as syntax errors, security vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks.
